# Hey There :wave:

## This was my second project in REACT!!

In this project, I created a web app that calculates change based off *amount due* and *amount received*.  It then breaks that down into the correct change denominations starting with twenties all the way down to pennies.  If the amount received is less than amount due, the app will throw a red alert bar to signify customer needs to provide additional funds.

To get started, open the app in VS code, or code editor of your choosing.  Install the necessary dependencies via the terminal by typing 'npm install'. Next, in the terminal, type 'node server/index.js' to start the app on the local node server. Open localhost:3000 in the browser of your choice.  

## ENJOY! :ok_hand:
